Follow the instructions in this file to make the playbook work correctly.
This was written to be used with Hetzner Cloud

1, export TF_VAR_hcloud_token="mytoken"

2, ansible is being called manually for now: ansible-playbook allnodes.yml -i inv --key-file=~/.ssh/terraform_pwless

Might be worthwhile disregarding ansible alltogether and use cloud-init script when an instance is deployed

3, The Terraform network config currently creates 2 private networks

Management network - 10.0.0.0/8
openstack_man_vlan1 - 10.0.2.0/24
node1 - 10.0.2.1
node2 - 10.0.2.2

Tenant network - 192.168.0.0/16
openstack_ten_vlan1 - 192.168.10.0/24
node1 - 192.168.10.1
node2 - 192.168.10.2


To Do:

1, Use terraform local-exec to remove entries from known_hosts so that ansible doesn't complain when its being played again a host existing in ~/.ssh/known_hosts
