Use the below method to make this playbook work:

1, export TF_VAR_hcloud_token="mytoken"

2, ansible is being called manually for now: ansible-playbook node1.yml -i inv --key-file=~/.ssh/terraform_pwless

Might be worthwhile disregarding ansible alltogether ans use cloud-init script when an instance is deployed
